For the MySQL exercise 3, if we needed, we could write a more generic
procedure that, for example:

 - Takes a parameter with the name of the table to process
 - Takes a parameter with the name column to split
 - Takes a parameter with the delimiter


For the Java exercises, I included tests in the same answer files, at the end of each one.


In the Java exercise 3, I read the file tests/TopPhrases.txt in the tests.
But I'm not checking the result in the tests of TopPhrases.java; I just display the top phrases.
